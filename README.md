At least for now, this is a minimalistic bug-reporting tool that will eventually use machine learning in the backend to automatically assign tickets (or at least suggest assignees). If this works well on training data, I will make it a JIRA plugin in my free time. Look for this on the Oracle Labs repo if we decide to release it.
